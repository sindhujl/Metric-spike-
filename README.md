# Metric-spike

**SCOPE**:

In this project, Key responsibility is investigating metric spikes, unraveling sudden changes in operation analytics and vital metrics, and providing daily answers to questions such as fluctuations in user engagement or sales drops.my focus is on leveraging advanced SQL skills to analyze datasets, offering actionable insights that enhance operational efficiency and address fluctuations in key metrics.


**DATA AND FINDINGS:**

The analysis of job data unveiled intriguing patterns in job reviews over time, showcasing a fluctuating daily trend with the lowest review count observed on 27/11/2020 (34.61 jobs/hr) and the highest on 28/11/2020 (218.18 jobs/hr). Throughput analysis, employing a 7-day rolling average, provided a nuanced perspective on job completion rates, offering a valuable tool for trend identification. Language share analysis revealed insights into language preferences over a span of 30 days. While duplicate rows were not detected, a robust query structure was established for future use. In the realm of user engagement, weekly analysis pinpointed noteworthy peaks and troughs, setting the stage for targeted investigations into periods of diminished engagement.Finally, the exploration of email engagement metrics showcased positive trends in the increased sending of weekly digest emails, correlating with rises in email opens and clickthrough rates.
